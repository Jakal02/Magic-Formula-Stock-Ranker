# Magic-Formula-Stock-Ranker
Pulls Data from Magic Formula site and Morningstar
----
The site https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/ lists stocks in alphabetical order, not by rank. This project will pull the tickers from the site, and then pull the neccesary financial data from Yahoo Finance to calculate the multiples, as described in the book "The Little Book That Beats The Market" by Joel Greenblatt.

The Selenium webscraper package was used for all website interaction
